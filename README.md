# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides coding challenges to help you improve your front-end coding skills.

## Challenges

The repository contains subdirectories for each challenge that I have completed. Each subdirectory contains a README file that explains the challenge and my solution.

Here are the challenges that I have completed so far:

- [Challenge 1: Results Summary Component](./results-summary-component/)
- [Challenge 2: Product Preview Card Component](./product-preview-card-component/)
- [Challenge 3: QR Code Component](./qr-code-component/)

## Technologies Used

For each challenge, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive website. I used the following tools and frameworks:

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## How to Run the Code

To view my solutions to the challenges, you can simply open the HTML files in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run a local web server to view the challenges. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the challenge subdirectory that you want to view (e.g., `cd results-summary-component`).
3. Start a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the challenge.
